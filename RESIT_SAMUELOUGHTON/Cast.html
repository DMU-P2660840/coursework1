      <p class="CastTxt3-2">Chloe is not in much as the film but when she is she makes a massive impact as she is the only person
      to give tom advice and the advice is always right. Best quote is "just because she has everything in common with you
      doesn't make her your soul mate tom" Brilliant charcter and always comes into the film just when the audience and tom needs her the most!</p>
