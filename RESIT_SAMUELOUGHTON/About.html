      <div class="Synopsis">
        <p>Tom (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), greeting-card writer and hopeless romantic, is caught completely off-guard when his girlfriend, Summer (Zooey Deschanel), suddenly dumps him. He reflects on their 500 days together to try to figure out where their love affair went sour, and in doing so, Tom rediscovers his true passions in life.
        <p>directed by marc webb and starring joseph gordon levitt as Tom, this film really opens your eyes on what it means to be in love
          and not the idea of love. no film has done it as well marc webb did in this film. Marc even throws in some funny action sequences (a hint towards his future career as spiderman) (<i>500 days of summer </i>, 2009).</p>
